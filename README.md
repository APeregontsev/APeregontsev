## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Worked as a business analyst for 12 years, now I want to switch to development.
I'm currently looking for opportunities. I love to learn and contribute in any and every possible way. I'm passionate about technology, history.</br>
I work according to the principle of "things to be done" - till the victorious end.</br>

<b>My technology stack:</b></br>
HTML5 | CSS3 | JS | React | Redux | React-hooks | Custom hooks | React-router | CSS Modules | Classnames | Sass | Less | REST API | OOP | Typescript | Node JS | Express JS</br>

<b>Some of my recent projects:</b>
<pre>Custom table build from data obtained via API: advanced search (highlighting of the 
searching fragment), advanced sorting (descending / ascending by clicking on the column 
name), pagination, saving data to session, custom hooks, etc. (React)</pre>
<b>   Deploy:</b> https://aperegontsev.github.io/cra_custom_table_advanced/
<pre>Custom multi-select as a separate component (React | TS)</pre>
<b>   Deploy:</b> https://aperegontsev.github.io/cra_multiselect_component/
<pre>Test internet shop (React | Redux, backend made with Node.js | Express | MySQL)</pre>
<b>   Deploy:</b> https://aperegontsev.github.io/cra_test_shop_front/</br>

<b>Completed almost all tasks on the frontendmentor.io, below are some of them (made with 
React):</b>
